# Spotify Playlist Archiver
This is a script I run weekly in AWS Lambda. Spotify rotates certain playlists
on a weekly basis, two of which are Release Radar and Discover Weekly. This
tool archives the songs included in these playlists so that when the playlist is rotated,
I still have a record of the previous songs.
